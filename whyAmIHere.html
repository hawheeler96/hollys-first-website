        <p>After graduating college, I worked for nearly 5 years at Twitter in San Francisco. While I was not on a highly technical team, I got to work with engineers on different projects. I became interested in how they did what they did, but it seemed so far out of my reach that I didn’t really look into it further. After getting laid off this year, though, I started to experiment with Python, and found I really enjoyed it. I’m hoping to get to explore further through this program, and hopefully find a job doing something with my new-found skill set.</p>
